# VanillaJSValidationForm - 1/20
Basic vanilla JavaScript validation form

This project is the first project in 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript by Brad Traversy on Udemy.com

This project is a basic validation form, requiring you to enter a username, email, password and password confirmation.

The project is to showcase a basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript project - although one in which scalability is built in.
